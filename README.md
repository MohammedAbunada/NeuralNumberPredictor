# Neural Number Predictor

This project was created to hard code a neural network with fully funcitoning back propogation from scratch. It was to learn in depth how exactly a neural network learns, all calculations were done prior to the coding. The network is coded in c# and is created with three classes: a Node, Link and Model.

The MNIST dataset was used to train the model and ended up with an accuracy of 93.71% with 4 hidden layers of 50 neurons each.
